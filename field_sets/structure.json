Cases that do not appear to have this dyadic structure could possibly reduce to familiar organizational forms (e.g. a corporation and its market of consumers; a mass media journalistic organization and its reading public, an acephalous social movement etc.). Information in this section should help outline the basic size, extent and relationship of these two entities.",

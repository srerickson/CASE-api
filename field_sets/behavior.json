Is it making a product, providing a service, or something else entirely? What are the stated or unstated goals of the project, and which tasks are designed to achieve these goals? How are the tasks organized, are they tightly or loosely structured? Are there clear comparable metrics for completion of a task? A key goal of this section is to articulate what level of meaningful participation people are engaging in with the project. Are they mere clickworkers or \"Turkers\" or are they meaningfully and deeply engaged in both the solving of a problem and the definition of what the problem is?",

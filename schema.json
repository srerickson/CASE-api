Cases that do not appear to have this dyadic structure could possibly reduce to familiar organizational forms (e.g. a corporation and its market of consumers; a mass media journalistic organization and its reading public, an acephalous social movement etc.). Information in this section should help outline the basic size, extent and relationship of these two entities.",

In particular, how is the FSE/OP relationship related to its formation (did it start as an OP and create an FSE as it grew, or start as an FSE and try to magic an OP into existence, or neither?)",

How are the tasks organized, are they tightly or loosely structured? Are there clear comparable metrics for completion of a task? A key goal of this section is to articulate what level of meaningful participation people are engaging in with the project. Are they mere clickworkers or \"Turkers\" or are they meaningfully and deeply engaged in both the solving of a problem and the definition of what the problem is?",
